This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on the area of the house. It uses Python's pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of two CSV files:
- `homeprices.csv`: Contains house prices and corresponding areas.
- `areas.csv`: Contains areas for which house prices need to be predicted.

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
